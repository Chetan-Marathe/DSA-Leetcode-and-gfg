75. Sort Colors
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Code:

class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int count0 = 0, count1 = 0, count2 = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) count0++;
            else if (num == 1) count1++;
            else count2++;
        }

        int index = 0;
        while (count0-- > 0) nums[index++] = 0;
        while (count1-- > 0) nums[index++] = 1;
        while (count2-- > 0) nums[index++] = 2;
    }
}
